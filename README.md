# Network-IDS
This a tkinter Python based realtime Network IDS Application where 3 Datasets 
Benchmark: CICIDS2017, NSL-KDD
Customized: Home Network Dataset
are preprocessed, normalized and multiple machine learning and deep learning models trained on them with 90+ accuracy prediction and evaluation metrics. 

First interface is the Main dashboard which is in "Dashboard.py", from which you can click on machine learning models interface named as "ml_horizontal.py", and deep learning model interface as "dl_interface.py" and also can see the reports.

Multiple Models of Machine Learning and Deep Learning are utilized, You can choose any model from the options and when starting it will diplay the prediction in real-time and can also check reports of the concluded files of datasets. 

All other csv files are normalized dataset files , .joblib and .pkl files are model files.
